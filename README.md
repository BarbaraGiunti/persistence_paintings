	- To run them on the same data as in the paper, download the folders from Zenodo, and unzip them. Place them in a folder called "paintings" and put the Python scripts from this GitHub repo in the same location
	- To run them on your own data, change the paths in the scripts to where your images are located
- Run the scripts on Jupyter, the first cells install the needed packages
